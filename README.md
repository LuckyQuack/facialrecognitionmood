TODO:
We need to work on fixing some stuff before we can start our experiment
- tweak facial recognition; right now it detects neutral too much, we need to prioritize accuracy (also we are only detecting happy, sad, neutral for simplicity)
- gui visual graph; right now it's a line plot but it's not correct, we need to make it work and also look more nice

Research questions
- How do users perceive and interact with facial
recognition technology for emotion tracking and wellbeing monitoring?

- What factors influence user trust, acceptance, and willingness to integrate facial recognition-based emotion tracking into their
daily routines?
