# How to run
- You can try either the executable file or installing everything yourself

## Executable:
- Just run the .exe, it might not work though I haven't tested

## Installing everything yourself:
- I think you should first create a python virtual environment and activate it before you pip install stuff, so look up how to do that
- Run this: Pip install PyQt6 matplotlib numpy opencv-python tensorflow mediapipe
- Running python main.py should work now
